# 📉 Trend Following Strategies in Markets Repository

## 📚 Overview
This repository serves as a personal collection of strategies I've been exploring, with a focus on understanding and applying the principles of trend trading.

## Approach

### 1. Strategy Development
I develop trend trading strategies, which involve identifying and leveraging long-term market movements. Trend trading is based on the idea that markets exhibit persistent directions (trends) over time. These strategies often look for 'fat-tail' distributions, where rare, significant events provide substantial trading opportunities.

### 2. Monte-Carlo Permutation Tests
Before considering backtesting, I employ Monte-Carlo permutation tests. These simulations are crucial for understanding the role of randomness in a strategy's performance. They help in distinguishing between actual strategy effectiveness and outcomes influenced by chance. This is especially important in trend trading, where aligning with long-term market trends could be mistaken for random fluctuations.

### 3. Backtesting
After confirming a strategy's potential through Monte-Carlo testing, I move to backtesting it against historical data. This process is critical for assessing a strategy's viability and success probability in real-world conditions. It's important to conduct backtesting after Monte-Carlo tests to avoid overfitting strategies to historical data, which can give misleadingly optimistic results.

## 🧪 Current Strategy Analysis

### 1. ATR Volatility Break Strategy
This strategy utilizes the Average True Range (ATR), a measure of market volatility. It's designed to capitalize on market trends following significant volatility breakouts. The strategy is based on the premise that high volatility periods, indicated by an elevated ATR, can often precede major market trends.
