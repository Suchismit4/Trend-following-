ðŸ“‰ Trend Following Strategies in Markets Repository ðŸ“š
Welcome to my repository focused on the analysis and development of trend following strategies for financial markets. This repository serves as a personal collection of strategies I've been exploring, with a focus on understanding and applying the principles of trend trading.

Approach:

Strategy Development: I develop trend trading strategies, seeking to harness the momentum of market movements.
Monte-Carlo Permutation Tests: To quantify the influence of randomness in strategy performance, Monte-Carlo permutation tests are employed. This step is crucial for differentiating between genuine strategy effectiveness and mere chance.
Backtesting: Each strategy undergoes thorough backtesting against historical data. This process is vital for assessing the viability and potential success of the strategy in real market conditions.
ðŸ§ª Current Strategy Analysis:

ATR Volatility Break Strategy: This strategy utilizes the Average True Range (ATR), a tool for measuring market volatility. The strategy aims to identify and capitalize on market trends following significant volatility breakouts. The premise is that high volatility, as indicated by an elevated ATR, can often precede major market movements. By strategically positioning at these points, the goal is to capture and benefit from potential market trends.
This repository is an ongoing project and will continue to evolve as more strategies are analyzed and developed.

ðŸ”„ Feedback and Contributions:

While this is a personal project, feedback and contributions are welcome. Collaborative discussions and suggestions can provide valuable insights into refining and enhancing these strategies.
